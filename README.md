### Theory
<li>COVID-19 has completely changed the worldâ€™s view on pandamic with direct consequences to global health and economy.</li>
<li>During this ongoing COVID-19 pandamic,mainly government have implemented various social distancing measures Such as travel restractions,
    border control,closingpublic places,and warning their citizens to keep 2 meter distance from each other when they go outside.</li>
<li>The main safety measure suggesred by WHO is maintain Social Distance with others to reduce the risk of infection when they cough,
sneeze or speak.In the current scenario the only system having to maintain the social distancing in public places like cctv which monioredby the humans</li>
<li>A deep learning,python,computer vision is proposed to utilizes object detection and tracking models to aid in the distancing remedy for dealing with the 
    escalation of COVID-19 cases.</li>
<li>To visualize the cluster in the live stream ,each bounding box is coloured based on its association with the group where people belonging to the same group 
    are represented with the same colour</li>
<li>Vedio is taken as input</li>

### Requirements:
<li>Python 3.5.2</li>
<li>Opencv(CV2) 4.2.0</li>
<li>numpy 1.14.5</li>

### For person detection
<li>MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel, MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt</li>
